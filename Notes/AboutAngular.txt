AngularJS
Fengið frá www.angularJS.org 


AngularJS is 100% JavaScript, 100% client-side and compatible with both desktop and mobile browsers. So it's definitely not a plugin or some other native browser extension.

bidirectional data binding. The template is compiled in the browser and the compilation step produces a live view. This means you, the developers, don't need to write code to constantly sync the view with the model and the model with the view as in other templating systems.

Do I need to worry about security holes in AngularJS?
Like any other technology, AngularJS is not impervious to attack. Angular does, however, provide built-in protection from basic security holes, including cross-site scripting and HTML injection attacks. AngularJS does round-trip escaping on all strings for you and even offers XSRF protection for server-side communication.

AngularJS was designed to be compatible with other security measures like Content Security Policy (CSP), HTTPS (SSL/TLS) and server-side authentication and authorization that greatly reduce the possible attack vectors and we highly recommend their use.

Works in the following browsers: Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera 15, IE9 and mobile browsers (Android, Chrome Mobile, iOS Safari).

The size of the file is < 36KB compressed and minified.

General Features
The general features of AngularJS are as follows:

AngularJS is a efficient framework that can create Rich Internet Applications (RIA).

AngularJS provides developers an options to write client side applications using JavaScript in a clean Model View Controller (MVC) way.

Applications written in AngularJS are cross-browser compliant. AngularJS automatically handles JavaScript code suitable for each browser.

AngularJS is open source, completely free, and used by thousands of developers around the world. It is licensed under the Apache license version 2.0.

Overall, AngularJS is a framework to build large scale, high-performance, and easy-to-maintain web applications.

Core Features
The core features of AngularJS are as follows:

Data-binding: It is the automatic synchronization of data between model and view components.

Scope: These are objects that refer to the model. They act as a glue between controller and view.

Controller: These are JavaScript functions bound to a particular scope.

Services: AngularJS comes with several built-in services such as $http to make a XMLHttpRequests. These are singleton objects which are instantiated only once in app.

Filters: These select a subset of items from an array and returns a new array.

Directives: Directives are markers on DOM elements such as elements, attributes, css, and more. These can be used to create custom HTML tags that serve as new, custom widgets. AngularJS has built-in directives such as ngBind, ngModel, etc.

Templates:These are the rendered view with information from the controller and model. These can be a single file (such as index.html) or multiple views in one page using partials.

Routing: It is concept of switching views.

Model View Whatever: MVW is a design pattern for dividing an application into different parts called Model, View, and Controller, each with distinct responsibilities. AngularJS does not implement MVC in the traditional sense, but rather something closer to MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel). The Angular JS team refers it humorously as Model View Whatever.

Deep Linking: Deep linking allows to encode the state of application in the URL so that it can be bookmarked. The application can then be restored from the URL to the same state.

Dependency Injection: AngularJS has a built-in dependency injection subsystem that helps the developer to create, understand, and test the applications easily.

Concepts
The following diagram depicts some important parts of AngularJS which we will discuss in detail in the subsequent chapters.

AngularJS Concepts
Advantages of AngularJS
The advantages of AngularJS are:

It provides the capability to create Single Page Application in a very clean and maintainable way.

It provides data binding capability to HTML. Thus, it gives user a rich and responsive experience.

AngularJS code is unit testable.

AngularJS uses dependency injection and make use of separation of concerns.

AngularJS provides reusable components.

With AngularJS, the developers can achieve more functionality with short code.

In AngularJS, views are pure html pages, and controllers written in JavaScript do the business processing.

On the top of everything, AngularJS applications can run on all major browsers and smart phones, including Android and iOS based phones/tablets.

Disadvantages of AngularJS
Though AngularJS comes with a lot of merits, here are some points of concern:

Not secure : Being JavaScript only framework, application written in AngularJS are not safe. Server side authentication and authorization is must to keep an application secure.

Not degradable: If the user of your application disables JavaScript, then nothing would be visible, except the basic page

MVC is a software architecture pattern that separates representation from user interaction.
Generally, the model consists of application data and functions that interact with it, while
the view presents this data to the user; the controller mediates between the two.
This separation presentation¹⁵ makes a clear division between objects in our web app so
that the view doesn’t need to know how to save an object – it just needs to know how to
display it. Meanwhile, the model doesn’t need to interact with the view – it just needs to
contain the data and methods to manipulate the view. The controller is where we’ll place
the logic to bind the two together.
